### Backstory

This project was developed as part of a bonus question for the first assignment of the course "Data Structures and Programming Techniques" (course professor: Manolis Koubarakis).

Spring semester 2022 - 2nd semester of my undergraduate studies.

The game was published on **ithc.io** on *July 11th 2022* (right after the semester ended).
